# FastDDM tutorials

## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://fastddm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) on the documentation.
FastDDM was tested on different OSs and Python versions.
It can also be used with [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
If you experience troubles installing the library, this might be due to incompatibilities in the system path variables or with the compiler used.
